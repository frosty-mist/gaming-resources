## The Time Loop

Parabox's time loop is a system where a world checkpoint will be taken, and all changes in the world will then be nullified when the time loop ends.

To begin a time loop, all logged in players will need to vote by clicking a button in the Parabox. 

While the Parabox is active, and the time loop is running, the Parabox will consume power every 10 minutes and generate a prestige point.  The amount of power needed is 10M RF, and increases by another 10M RF every completed cycle.

## Ending the Time Loop

Once the time loop has begun, there are three methods of stopping it.

### Collapsing the World

Collapsing the world will reset the world (but not players) back to the original state when the loop began, and grant all players the prestige points that have generated.

### Deactivating the Parabox

Deactivation will disable the loop, but will void any generated prestige points.

### Power Failure

If the time comes for the parabox to consume power, and it cannot, it will be automatically deactivated.
